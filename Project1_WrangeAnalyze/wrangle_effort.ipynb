    "# Wrangling efforts\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the available information in the project I have summarised my wrangling efforts as below-\n",
    "\"\n",
    "Enhanced Twitter Archive\n",
    "\n",
    "The WeRateDogs Twitter archive contains basic tweet data for all 5000+ of their tweets, but not everything. One column the archive does contain though: each tweet's text, which I used to extract rating, dog name, and dog \"stage\" (i.e. doggo, floofer, pupper, and puppo) to make this Twitter archive \"enhanced.\" Of the 5000+ tweets, I have filtered for tweets with ratings only (there are 2356).\n",
    "\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## What we know-\n",
    "Some ratings are not correct\n",
    "Dog names could be incorrect\n",
    "Dog stages are incorrect\n",
    "Original ratings and no retweets\n",
    "no need to go beyond August 1st, 2017\n",
    "\n",
    "### Effort\n",
    "\n",
    "I have made use of libraries and methods taught as part of the first module. I have heavily relied on using pandas apply method to filter out and fix necessary issues that are document below. I have additionally read the pandas documentation to fix timestamp issues using the method 'to_datetime'.\n",
    "I have consolidated the final cleaned data in a csv file called 'twitter_archive_master.csv' and read the same in the master data frame called df_master\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Gathering of data:\n",
    "- Twitter archive\n",
    "- image_predictions\n",
    "- extended tweets data\n",
    "\n",
    "I tried playing with the twitter APIs, however no free version of APIs support this use-case hence had to resort back to using the data available in the project\n",
    "\n",
    "### Quality issues\n",
    "df_twitter:-\n",
    "- 1) tweet_id is int\n",
    "- 2) timestamp is object\n",
    "- 3) expanded urls has missing data\n",
    "- 4) tweet_id with 810984652412424192 doesn't have rating and 666287406224695296 has incorrect i.e. 9/10 instead of 1/2\n",
    "- 5) Name for dogs 'None' counted as object\n",
    "- 6) Incomplete data for Dog names\n",
    "- 7) Incomplete stages for dogs\n",
    "- 8) source column can be standardised i.e. iphone, webclient, vine etc\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "df_tweet:-\n",
    "- 9) extended_entities colum in df_tweets has media_urls\n",
    "\n",
    "df_image:-\n",
    "- 10) 2075 entries for data(sort missing data)\n",
    "- 11) column names for p1 algorithm, p1_conf and p1_dog as user friendly names\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tidiness issues\n",
    "df_twitter:-\n",
    "- 1) Dog stages mentioned as columns \n",
    "- 2) dog images and dog stages should be combined\n",
    "- 3) Tweet information should be a separate table\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Final files\n",
    "1. twitter_archive_master.csv\n",
    "2. Data Frames:\n",
    "    - df_master \n",
    "    - df_tweets_data\n",
    "    - df_dogs_data\n",
